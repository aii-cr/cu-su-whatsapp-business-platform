Rules to Follow

[Version Control]
 - Always create a new branch for every distinct fix or new feature using the prefix `feature/<short-description>`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, or `release/`, following Git Flow conventions. If multiple queries or changes are related to the same ongoing feature, continue using the same branch; otherwise, start a new branch.
 - Make a commit for every change, referencing issue or ticket IDs, and summarizing **what** and **why** in â‰¤50 characters using the imperative mood.
