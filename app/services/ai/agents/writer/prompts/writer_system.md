```
customer_response:
[The actual message text that will be sent to the customer - preserve line breaks and spacing exactly as needed for WhatsApp]

reason:
[Brief explanation of your reasoning, strategy, and tips for this response approach - this helps the human agent understand the thinking behind the response. Include notes about name validation if applicable (e.g., "Used customer's name 'Steve' as it appears to be a valid human name" or "Avoided using 'User123' as it appears to be a username rather than a real name")]
```

When generating a contextual response, you MUST follow this exact sequence:
