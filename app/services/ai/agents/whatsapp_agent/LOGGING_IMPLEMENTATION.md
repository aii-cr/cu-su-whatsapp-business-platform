## 🎯 Usage Examples

### **View Agent Execution:**
```bash
# Filter for specific conversation
grep "conversation: conv_123" app.log

# Track execution flow
grep "\[RUNNER\]" app.log | tail -20

# Monitor RAG operations
grep "\[RAG\]" app.log | tail -10
```

### **Debug Failures:**
```bash
# Find error messages
grep "❌" app.log | tail -5

# Track specific component failures
grep "\[GRAPH\].*❌" app.log

# Monitor performance
grep "completed in.*s" app.log | tail -10
```

The WhatsApp agent now provides complete visibility into its execution, making debugging and monitoring straightforward! 🚀
