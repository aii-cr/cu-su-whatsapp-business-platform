# WhatsApp Business API Setup Guide

## Issue Analysis

Based on the debug tests, your WhatsApp API calls are working correctly:
- ✅ API calls return status 200
- ✅ Messages are accepted by WhatsApp
- ✅ Phone number is valid and registered
- ❌ **Webhook not properly configured** - This is likely why you're not seeing delivery status updates

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Message sending API calls
- Phone number validation
- Template messages (as you confirmed)

### What's Not Working
- Webhook delivery status updates
- Message delivery confirmation

## Required Configuration

### 1. Webhook URL Configuration

Your current webhook URL is set to a placeholder: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/whatsapp`

**You need to:**

1. **Deploy your backend to a public domain** (or use ngrok for testing)
2. **Update the webhook URL** in your Meta Developer Console
3. **Configure webhook fields** to receive delivery status updates

### 2. Meta Developer Console Setup

1. Go to [Meta Developer Console](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Navigate to your WhatsApp Business app
3. Go to **Webhooks** section
4. Configure the webhook URL to point to your actual domain:
   ```
   https://your-actual-domain.com/api/v1/whatsapp/webhook
   ```
5. Set the verify token to match your `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`
6. **Subscribe to these fields:**
   - `messages` (for incoming messages)
   - `message_deliveries` (for delivery status)
   - `message_reads` (for read receipts)

### 3. Environment Variables Update

Update your `.env` file with the correct webhook URL:

```env
# Update this to your actual domain
WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-actual-domain.com/api/v1/whatsapp"
```

### 4. Webhook Verification

Your webhook verification endpoint is already implemented at:
```
GET /api/v1/whatsapp/webhook
```

This should return the challenge parameter when Meta verifies your webhook.

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Deploy or Expose Your Backend

**Option A: Deploy to a cloud service**
- Deploy your FastAPI app to Heroku, Railway, or similar
- Update the webhook URL to your deployed domain

**Option B: Use ngrok for local testing**
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose your local server
ngrok http 8000

# Use the ngrok URL as your webhook URL
# Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/v1/whatsapp/webhook
```

### Step 2: Update Webhook Configuration

1. Update your `.env` file with the new webhook URL
2. Configure the webhook in Meta Developer Console
3. Verify the webhook is working by checking the verification endpoint

### Step 3: Test Message Delivery

1. Send a message using your API
2. Check the webhook logs for delivery status updates
3. Monitor the message status in your database

## Webhook Status Monitoring

Your backend already has webhook processing implemented. Check these endpoints:

- **Webhook test**: `GET /api/v1/whatsapp/webhook/test`
- **Webhook logs**: Check your database `webhook_logs` collection
- **Message status**: Check the `status` field in your `messages` collection

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Webhook Not Receiving Updates
**Solution**: Ensure webhook URL is publicly accessible and properly configured

### Issue 2: Messages Accepted But Not Delivered
**Solution**: This is normal - WhatsApp accepts messages but delivery depends on:
- Recipient's phone being online
- Recipient's privacy settings
- Network connectivity

### Issue 3: Template Messages Work But Free Text Don't
**Solution**: This suggests the recipient hasn't initiated a conversation. WhatsApp requires:
- First message must be a template (which works)
- Subsequent messages can be free text (after customer responds)

## Debugging Commands

### Check Webhook Status
```bash
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/whatsapp/webhook/test"
```

### Check Message Status in Database
```python
# In your MongoDB
db.messages.find({"whatsapp_message_id": "wamid.HBgLNTA2ODQ3MTY1OTIVAgARGBIyMjEzRDBENzdENjgyRjQ1RTkA"})
```

### Monitor Webhook Logs
```python
# Check webhook processing logs
db.webhook_logs.find().sort({"processed_at": -1}).limit(10)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy your backend** to a public domain
2. **Update webhook URL** in Meta Developer Console
3. **Test with a real conversation** (send template first, then free text)
4. **Monitor webhook logs** for delivery status updates

## Important Notes

- **Template messages work** because they don't require customer initiation
- **Free text messages** require the customer to have messaged your business first
- **Delivery status** is only available via webhooks, not API responses
- **Message acceptance** (status 200) doesn't guarantee delivery to the recipient's device

The fact that your API calls are successful means your implementation is correct. The missing piece is proper webhook configuration to receive delivery status updates.
