## ‚úÖ Description of the Problem

Develop an AI-powered WhatsApp Business platform designed to provide a cost-effective solution for companies seeking to enhance customer support.

## ‚úÖ Specific User Problematic

Our Internet Service Provider business currently relies on an expensive WhatsApp Business platform that lacks key features our company needs. For example, it lacks the ability to smoothly transfer or escalate conversations between agents internally without notifying or disrupting the customer. The platform also lacks conversation tagging for better classification and organization, and it does not provide an AI-powered chatbot to handle basic customer inquiries or automate processes such as acquiring a new service, generating payment links, and scheduling installation appointments in real time based on both customer and technician availability.

This limited functionality not only creates operational inefficiencies but also leads to high annual costs for the company. A new AI-powered solution would significantly reduce expenses while introducing advanced features such as automated conversation summarization, mood-based emoji tagging, AI-generated responses, and real-time assistance for employees on how to better handle customer interactions.

## ‚úÖ Proposal for AI Agent Usage in Our App

The platform will leverage an AI agent built with LangGraph to handle multi-step, automated workflows. The agent will have access to internal APIs to perform key tasks such as checking available installation dates, retrieving and presenting internet service options to customers, and generating payment links for selected services. This agentic reasoning approach allows the system to dynamically plan and execute these steps in real time, significantly automating the onboarding process for new customers and reducing the workload on human agents.


## ‚úÖ Data Sources and External API Integrations 


The data sources for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system will include the company‚Äôs public information, frequently asked questions and answers, and detailed data about all internet service plans, including pricing, speeds, and features. This information will enable the AI to provide accurate, context-aware responses to customer inquiries.

For external APIs, the platform will integrate with the existing internal API to retrieve available installation and reservation dates for online purchases. This will allow customers to select a convenient time to receive technicians. Once the service and appointment are confirmed, another internal API will be used to generate a secure payment link based on the selected plan, enabling the AI agent to complete the checkout process and guide the customer through finalizing their purchase.

## ‚úÖ Chunking Strategy Implementation

The RAG system implements a **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** approach optimized for the company's documentation structure. Located in `/app/services/ai/shared/tools/rag/ingest.py`, the chunking strategy uses a 800-character chunk size with 120-character overlap, which has proven effective for maintaining context while ensuring optimal retrieval performance.

This chunking approach was specifically chosen to handle the structured nature of internet service documentation, where information about plans, pricing, and technical specifications needs to be kept coherent. The recursive splitting method intelligently attempts to break documents at natural boundaries like sentences and paragraphs, rather than arbitrary character limits.

The implementation enhances each chunk with comprehensive metadata including source information, language indicators, and content versioning. This metadata-rich approach enables the RAG system to perform more targeted retrieval based on document type, language, and content freshness. The 120-character overlap ensures that context isn't lost at chunk boundaries, which is particularly important for technical specifications that might span multiple chunks.

When customers ask specific questions about service plans or technical details, this chunking strategy ensures that relevant information is retrieved as complete, contextual units rather than fragmented text pieces.
