# Unread Messages Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation fixes the unread messages functionality and chat scroll behavior for the WhatsApp Business Platform. The main issues were:

1. **Unread Messages Not Being Marked as Read**: WebSocket connection status was not properly tracked
2. **Chat Scroll Not at Bottom**: Scroll behavior needed improvement
3. **Unread Banner Logic**: Banner should only appear when agent is not currently viewing

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated `useUnreadMessages` Hook (`frontend/src/features/conversations/hooks/useUnreadMessages.ts`)

**Key Improvements:**
- Added `isCurrentlyViewing` state to track if agent is actively viewing conversation
- Added `lastViewTimeRef` to track when agent last viewed the conversation
- Improved WebSocket connection status checking using both `wsClient.isConnected` and `providedIsConnected`
- Enhanced auto-mark-as-read logic with 30-second threshold for "currently viewing"
- Better banner visibility logic that considers viewing state

**New Features:**
- Auto-mark messages as read when agent is currently viewing and new messages arrive
- Proper unread count tracking that resets when agent views conversation
- Improved WebSocket message handling for read confirmations

#### 2. Updated Conversation Page (`frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/conversations/[id]/page.tsx`)

**Key Improvements:**
- Added `shouldScrollToBottom` state to track scroll position
- Enhanced scroll behavior with `handleScroll` callback
- Improved auto-scroll logic that respects user's scroll position
- Better scroll timing and behavior for new messages
- Added scroll position tracking to prevent unwanted auto-scroll

**New Features:**
- Smart auto-scroll that only scrolls when user is near bottom
- Smooth scrolling for new messages
- Better handling of message loading and scroll positioning

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated WebSocket Service (`app/services/websocket/websocket_service.py`)

**Key Improvements:**
- Enhanced `notify_incoming_message_processed` to auto-mark messages as read for viewing agents
- Added automatic message status update when assigned agent is currently viewing
- Improved unread count management logic

**New Features:**
- Auto-mark messages as read when assigned agent is viewing conversation
- Real-time notification of read status updates
- Better handling of conversation assignment and unread counts

#### 2. Updated WebSocket Route Handler (`app/api/routes/websocket.py`)

**Key Improvements:**
- Enhanced `handle_mark_messages_read` with better error handling
- Added conversation update notifications when messages are marked as read
- Improved error messaging for failed operations

**New Features:**
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Conversation update notifications for UI refresh
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## How It Works

### Unread Message Flow

1. **Inbound Message Arrives:**
   - Message is created with status "received"
   - WebSocket notification is sent to conversation subscribers
   - If assigned agent is viewing conversation → auto-mark as read
   - If assigned agent is not viewing → increment unread count

2. **Agent Views Conversation:**
   - Agent subscribes to conversation via WebSocket
   - Auto-mark-as-read is triggered after 1 second delay
   - All unread inbound messages are marked as read
   - Unread count is reset to 0
   - Banner is hidden

3. **New Messages While Viewing:**
   - If agent is currently viewing (within 30 seconds) → auto-mark as read
   - If agent is not currently viewing → show banner and increment count

### Chat Scroll Behavior

1. **Initial Load:**
   - Always scroll to bottom on first load
   - Smooth scrolling behavior

2. **New Messages:**
   - If user is near bottom → auto-scroll to show new messages
   - If user is scrolled up → don't auto-scroll (respects user position)

3. **Scroll Position Tracking:**
   - Monitors scroll position to determine if user is "near bottom"
   - Uses 150px threshold for better UX

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Unread Messages:**
   - Send inbound message from customer
   - Verify unread count increases
   - Verify banner appears if agent is not viewing
   - Enter conversation and verify messages are auto-marked as read

2. **Test Auto-Mark as Read:**
   - Be in conversation view
   - Send inbound message from customer
   - Verify message is automatically marked as read
   - Verify no unread count or banner appears

3. **Test Chat Scroll:**
   - Load conversation with many messages
   - Verify scroll to bottom on initial load
   - Scroll up and send new message
   - Verify no auto-scroll (respects position)
   - Scroll near bottom and send message
   - Verify auto-scroll to show new message

### Debug Information

The implementation includes debug information in development mode:
- WebSocket connection status
- Unread count tracking
- Banner visibility state
- Currently viewing state
- Manual test buttons for marking as read

## Configuration

### Frontend Configuration

- **Auto-mark delay**: 1 second (configurable in `useUnreadMessages`)
- **Currently viewing threshold**: 30 seconds (configurable in `useUnreadMessages`)
- **Scroll threshold**: 150px from bottom (configurable in conversation page)

### Backend Configuration

- **Message status**: Uses `MessageStatus.READ` enum
- **WebSocket notifications**: Real-time updates for all subscribers
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error logging and user feedback

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Messages are automatically marked as read when agent is viewing
2. **Better Performance**: Smart scroll behavior prevents unwanted auto-scroll
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket ensures immediate status updates
4. **WhatsApp-like Behavior**: Banner only appears when agent is not viewing
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Future Enhancements

1. **Read Receipts**: Show read status to customers
2. **Typing Indicators**: Real-time typing indicators
3. **Message Status**: More granular message status tracking
4. **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling for large conversations
5. **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly scroll behavior

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/features/conversations/hooks/useUnreadMessages.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/conversations/[id]/page.tsx`

### Backend
- `app/services/websocket/websocket_service.py`
- `app/api/routes/websocket.py`

### Tests
- `tests/test_unread_messages.py` (created for testing)

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, WhatsApp-like unread message system with proper WebSocket integration, smart scroll behavior, and comprehensive error handling. The system automatically manages message read status based on agent viewing state and provides real-time updates through WebSocket connections.
